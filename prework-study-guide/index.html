        <h2>CSS Notes</h2>
     <ul>
       <li>The margin property indicates how much space we want aroud the outside of an element.  it's not visible on the page, it adds a buffer.

        <br />

        The padding property is often confused with margin but isn't the same. it adds space around the content indide an element. by increasing padding you are making the entire element bigger.
        <br />
        To understand this better, it is important to know that every HTML element is essentially a box. Each box consists of margins outside the element, and the element's borders, padding, and content. This is sometimes referred to as the CSS box model. </li>
     </ul>

   <br />

   <li>There are three ways to style a webpage using CSS: inline CSS, internal CSS style sheet, and external CSS style sheet. 
  </li>
  
  <br />

  <li>external CSS style sheet allows developers to keep all their CSS rules in a separate file, which makes design changes easier.
